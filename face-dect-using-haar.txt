fac detection merely detects the presence of a face in an img, 
while face recognition involves identifying whose face it involves

face detection is done by using classifier
classifier is an algo that decides whether a given image is positive or negative
whether the face is present or not

classifier needs to be trained on 1000s or 10s of 1000s of images with and without faces
opencv comes with alot of pre-trained classifiers

#haar cascades
#prone to noise in an image

face detection does not involve skin tone or the colors that are present in an image
look at the object of an img and using the edges treis to determine whether its a face or not
dont need color in our img
